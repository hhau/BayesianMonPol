Running from a command line

        R CMD BATCH --no-save Script.R

can be used to create the two panels shown in Figure 2 of the paper by
setting the value of K either 3 or 4 and choosing q to be odd ("q <-
2*K + 1").

The output of running this command on our system for various values of
K, and q either even or odd, are given in the subdirectory
ResultsForVariousValuesOfq.

For q less than 10, it was fine to use 50,000 iterations.  For larger
values of q we ran the script with 200,000 iterations to obtain
acceptable diagnostic plots.
