The files in this directory illustrate how to use the BUGS code from R
using OpenBUGS and BRugs.

The .bug files were derived from the corresponding files in the JAGS
directory by using the R snippet given in the article (and provided in
the file article.R in this directory) to unroll a for loop as
discussed in the article.  The settings used were:

  K <- 2 and q <- 2*K   for PolMonCompactEvenPred.bug
  K <- 2 and q <- 2*K+1 for PolMonCompactOddPred.bug
  K <- 2 and q <- 2*K+1 for PolMonRealLineOddPred.bug
  K <- 2 and q <- 2*K   for PolMonSemiCompactEvenPred.bug
  K <- 2 and q <- 2*K+1 for PolMonSemiCompactOddPred.bug

Thus, the files, as they are at the moment, are suitable for fitting
quartic and quintic monotone polynomials.  For polynomials of other
degrees the files have to be appropriately modified.

The files named Script*.R illustrate the use of this code.

To fit an odd polynomial that is monotone over the real line use:
   ScriptPolMonRealLinePred-BRugs.R
   PolMonRealLineOddPred.bug

To fit an even or odd polynomial that is monotone over a semi compact
interval use:
   ScriptPolMonSemiCompactPred-BRugs.R
   PolMonSemiCompactEvenPred.bug
   PolMonSemiCompactOddPred.bug

To fit an even or odd polynomial that is monotone over a compact
interval use:
   ScriptPolMonCompactPred-BRugs.R
   PolMonCompactEvenPred.bug
   PolMonCompactOddPred.bug
