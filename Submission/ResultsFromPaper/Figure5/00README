Running from a command line

        R CMD BATCH --no-save StanFit.R
	Or		Rscript StanFit.R

can be used to create the four panel image shown in Figure 5 of the paper.
The default arguments to generateCoveragePlots are the ones used to
generate the figure. The image is outputted as a .pdf to the working
directory. The multithreading aspect of the code was written to run
under a unix environment, and does not work as written on Windows.
This is easy to change if you need to (cease using the multicore package,
and use the "cores = numberOfThreads" argument, where 'numberOfThreads' is 
the number of threads you wish to run accross multiple CPU cores.
