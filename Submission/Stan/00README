Code to accompany the paper "Monotone Polynomials using BUGS and Stan"
by Manderson et al.

This folder  contains the *.stan file as described in the paper, as well as
a script file that can be used to drive this Stan program from R using
Stan and the R package rstan.

The combination of code and comments in the script file should hopefully
mean the process is fairly self explainitory. 

For q less than 10, it was fine to use 50,000 iterations.  For larger
values of q we ran the script with 200,000 iterations to obtain
acceptable diagnostic plots.
