Code to accompany the paper "Monotone Polynomials using BUGS and Stan"
by Manderson et al.

The folder JAGS contains the *.bug files as they are described in the
paper.  Script files that can be used to drive these BUGS programs
from R using JAGS and the R package rjags are also provided.

As discussed in the paper, for the BUGS language as implemented in
OpenBUGS (and WinBUGS) a loop in the code needs to be unrolled.  The
folder OpenBUGS contains the *.bug files of the JAGS directory with
that loop unrolled such that these files suitable for fitting quartic
or quintic polynomials, respectively.  The folder also contains the R
snippet from the paper that performs the unrolling of the loop so that
the files can be modified to fit polynomials of a different order.
Script files that can be used to drive these BUGS programs from R
using OpenBUGS and R package BRugs are also provided.

The folder Stan contains the *.stan file as described in the paper.
Script files that can be used to drive this Stan program from R using
Stan and the R package rstan are also provided.

The folder ResultsFromPaper contains code that reproduces the figures
shown in the paper.
